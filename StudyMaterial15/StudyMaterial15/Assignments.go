	LISKOV SUSTITUTION PRINCIPLE
	_____________________________________________________________________________
	Liskov's notion of a behavioural subtype defines a notion of substitutability 
	for objects; that is, if S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T in a 
	program may be replaced with objects of type S without altering any of the 
	desirable properties of that program (e.g. correctness).

	PRACTICE FOLLOWING JAVA CODE
